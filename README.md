# Crumpet - Toast (Android) for iOS

Written entirely in Swift here is my take on Toast for iOS. There are many alerntives already out there so Im keepoing my offering complermtly open and away from any dependacy management packages for now.

## üéß Alternative options
Bagel for Objective-C https://github.com/MrChrisBarker/bagel-objectivec-toast

## üé¨ Features
Toast like popup for iOS which can be added to a specific view or to the first main Window View. Default timings, colors and fonts are used but are also fully customisable too.

## üß∞ Installation
Add `Crumpet.swift` to your iOS project.

## üíª How to use

There are two options to choose from;

**1.** Add to specific UIView (this could be one of multiple Views in your Nib or UIViewController...)

```swift
let specificView = UIView()
Crumpet.shared.pop(message: "Added to a specific View", specificView)
```

**2.** Add to 'first' Window View found.

```swift
Crumpet.shared.pop(message: "Added to the Window View")
```

## üé® Customize

The folloing properties are avalable for your customization;

```swift
Crumpet.shared.speed
Crumpet.shared.wait
Crumpet.shared.backgroundColor
Crumpet.shared.textColor
Crumpet.shared.lineCount
Crumpet.shared.font
Crumpet.shared.textAlignment
Crumpet.shared.bottomConstraint
```
## üì± Support
- iOS 9.0+ (Tested)

## üõ£ Roadmap
- Look at Thread Safe options
- Improved customisations (based on feedback, if any üòù)
- User interaction (tapable)

## üìù Feedback / Contributions
More than welcome, drop me tweet or a PR and I'd be more than happy to chat or take a look.
